Problem1.java solves both problem 1 and problem 2 from the homework.
It also converts train.arff, test.arff and application.arff to train1.arff,
test1.arff, application1.arff in order to use the tf-idf values.
To run my classifier:
- run Problem1.java in a folder with the three arff files, so that the
corresponding tf-idf files can be created.
- run Problem3.java - it will output the results to barcute2_application_result.txt

Additional info:
- I am using a J48 tree with pruning enabled
- I use the tf-idf values as opposed to the raw data
- There is an ArrayList of stopwords I have created in Problem1.java which 
  makes the weights of non-important words equal to 0
